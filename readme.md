**This is a test to get keras and tensor flow to work properly**

Data at https://bit.ly/aiDataSet

At the moment we can create a model that recognizes between cat's and dogs as in the following example https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/vision/image_classification_using_global_context_vision_transformer.py
in trainModel.py

We also have a three division python running in threeOptions.py which for some reason cannot be interpreted by the example in imageRecognize.py

1. Clone the repository and unpack cats-dogs-kasperi.zip
2. install python modules pip3.12.exe install keras numpy tensorflow matplotlib pydot pydot_ng
3. clean the images via the following command python3 clean.py
4. train the model using trainModel.py or threeOptions.py
5. Wonder why imageRecognize.py doesn't work properly and divide the ersults to cats, dogs or kasperi?
